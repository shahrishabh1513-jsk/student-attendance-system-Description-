## 📌 About the Project

**Student Attendance Management System** is a lightweight, fully client-side web app that lets faculty take, track, and share classroom attendance — without needing a backend, a database, or an internet connection once loaded.

Everything runs in the browser using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, and all data is stored locally via `localStorage`. It's built for real classroom use: a weekly timetable drives what's being taught right now, attendance is marked with big one-tap buttons, and every saved session can be reviewed, edited, printed, or shared later — as an **Image, PDF, or Excel file** — straight to WhatsApp or Email.

> 💡 **Why this project?** Most college attendance workflows are either paper registers or heavy ERP portals. This project explores a middle ground: a clean, fast, installable-anywhere tool that a single faculty member can start using in under a minute.

- Filter records by date, subject, or batch
- **View → Edit → Re-save** any past session
- **Print** a formatted attendance report (A4-ready)
- **Export**: CSV (single record or bulk), and printable/shareable reports
- Built-in **sample data loader** for quick demos/testing

### 📤 Share Report

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1 — Just use the live version
No setup needed:
👉 **[Open the live app](https://shahrishabh1513-jsk.github.io/student-attendance-system-Description-/)**

### Option 2 — Run it locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shahrishabh1513-jsk/student-attendance-system-Description-.git

# 2. Move into the project folder
cd student-attendance-system-Description-

# 3. Serve it locally (recommended, so localStorage behaves consistently)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Opening `index.html` by double-clicking it works too, but some browsers isolate storage differently for files opened directly (`file://`). Running a local server avoids that entirely.

## 🧭 How It Works

```
Login  →  Dashboard  →  Timetable  →  (Batch, if Lab)  →  Take Attendance  →  Save  →  Reports
                ↑______________________________________________________________________|
                                     (review, edit, print, share anytime)
```

1. **Log in** with your faculty credentials.
2. Land on the **Dashboard** — see today's overview and recent activity.
3. Open the **Timetable**, tap the lecture you're teaching right now.
4. If it's a **Lab**, pick the batch (Batch 1 / Batch 2).
5. Mark each student **Present** or **Absent** with one tap.
6. Hit **Save Attendance** — you're taken straight to the saved report.
7. From **Reports**, revisit any session to view, edit, print, export, or share it.

## 🔒 Data & Privacy

This project stores **all data locally in your browser** (`localStorage`) — there is no backend server and no database.

- ✅ Works fully offline once the page is loaded
- ✅ Nothing is sent to any server
- ⚠️ Clearing your browser data will erase saved attendance — export/share important records regularly
- ⚠️ Data does not sync across devices or browsers (by design — this is a lightweight, single-device tool)

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Optional backend sync (Firebase / Supabase) for multi-device access
- [ ] Bulk student roster import/editor (CSV upload)
- [ ] Attendance analytics & trend charts per student/subject
- [ ] Dark mode refinements
- [ ] PWA support (installable, offline-first)
- [ ] Multi-faculty / multi-role accounts
